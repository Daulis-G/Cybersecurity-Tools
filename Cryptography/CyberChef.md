## [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)

CyberChef is a simple, intuitive web tool for analyzing, decoding, encoding, encrypting, and transforming digital data—often described as a “Cyber Swiss Army Knife.” 
It runs entirely in your browser, meaning your data stays local and secure.

## How to use

Drag and Drop: Simply drag your file or paste text into the input box. CyberChef can handle files up to about 2GB (browser-dependent).

Choose Operations: From hundreds of available operations (encoding, encryption, parsing, hashing, etc.), select them and combine into a “recipe.”

Run the Recipe: The operations are applied in sequence to your input data, producing output instantly.

Magic Feature: Use the 'Magic' operation to automatically detect encoding types and suggest appropriate operations.

Help: Hover over any feature and press F1 for contextual assistance.

No installation or advanced knowledge is required—just use your browser.

## Use Cases

Decrypt, decode, and analyze suspicious files, malware payloads, or encoded messages.

Extract strings, metadata, or certificates from binaries or emails.

Convert timestamps, base64, hex, or unicode formats.

Handle compressed files (gzip, ZIP), hash data, and transform formats.

Spot-check data, verify hashes, decode cookies, analyze URLs, and inspect certificates.
