## üîê [Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy)

PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is a cryptographic system used for encrypting and signing data, ensuring secure communication and verifying authenticity. PGP Lookup refers to public keyserver databases that allow users to search for, retrieve, and verify public PGP keys associated with email addresses or user IDs. These keyservers enable OSINT researchers to discover email addresses, verify identities, track digital footprints, and investigate communication patterns. Public PGP keys often contain metadata like creation dates, email addresses, associated identities, and key signatures that can reveal relationships between individuals.

## üí° Usage Examples and Common Commands

### **Basic Workflow:**

1. **Navigate to keyserver** - Choose from Ubuntu Keyserver, OpenPGP, or MIT PGP
2. **Enter search query** - Input email address, key ID, or name
3. **Review results** - Examine:
   - Public keys associated with the query
   - Email addresses in key metadata
   - Key creation dates and expiration
   - User IDs (UIDs) and signatures
   - Key fingerprints for verification

### **Common Use Cases:**

- Discover email addresses associated with a target
- Find alternative identities/usernames in key metadata
- Track key creation dates to establish timeline
- Identify relationships through key signatures
- Verify authenticity of communications
- Investigate developer identities in open-source projects
- Correlate keys across different platforms

## üíé Tips & Tricks for Competition Scenarios

1. **Email Discovery:** PGP keys often contain multiple email addresses (UIDs) - search by partial names to find all associated keys and look for typo variations or similar names
2. **Key Signatures:** Check who signed a key to identify trusted relationships and professional/social networks
