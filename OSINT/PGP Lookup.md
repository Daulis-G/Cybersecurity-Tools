## [Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy)

PGP cryptography allows a message to be encrypted so that it can only be decrypted by its intended recipient. 
To achieve this, the sender will use the recipient’s public key to encrypt the message so that only the recipient’s private key can decrypt the message.
