### Tips & Tricks for Competition Scenarios
1. **Multi-format scanning:** If unsure of barcode type, try "Auto-detect" or scan with multiple format selections
2. **Image quality matters:** For low-quality images, pre-process with contrast/brightness adjustments before uploading
3. **Batch processing:** For multiple barcodes in competitions, take screenshots and process sequentially
4. **QR code OSINT:** Decoded QR codes may contain:
   - WiFi credentials (SSID/password)
   - Contact vCards
   - Location coordinates
   - Hidden URLs
5. **Driver's License parsing:** ID card barcodes contain structured data - extract name, DOB, address, license number
6. **Postal barcode tracking:** Use decoded tracking numbers in postal service lookup tools
7. **Screenshot barcodes:** Use browser screenshot tools or Snipping Tool to capture barcodes from videos/documents
8. **PDF417 on IDs:** Common on government IDs and boarding passes - contains extensive metadata
9. **Combine with OCR:** If barcode fails, use OCR tools on visible text near barcode
10. **Privacy awareness:** Be cautious when sharing decoded personal data during team competitions
