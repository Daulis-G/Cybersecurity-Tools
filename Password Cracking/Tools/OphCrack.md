## ðŸ’¡ Tips & Tricks
### Best Practices and Time-Saving Techniques
1. **Start with Free Tables First** - Test with the free XP/Vista tables before investing in paid versions to gauge success probability
2. **Use OphCrack Live CD for Maximum Success** - Booting from the live CD bypasses OS security and provides direct SAM access
3. **Combine Multiple Rainbow Tables** - Load several table sets simultaneously to increase coverage and crack rates
4. **Sort by Password Length** - Focus on shorter passwords first as they crack significantly faster (statistics show 70%+ of passwords are â‰¤8 chars)
5. **Keep Tables on Fast Storage** - Store rainbow tables on SSDs rather than HDDs to dramatically reduce lookup times
6. **Check for Empty/Blank Passwords First** - OphCrack can instantly identify accounts with no password - always check these before running full tables
7. **Use the Right Table for the OS Version** - Vista/7/8/10 require NTLM tables while XP works better with LM tables
8. **Monitor the Success Rate Graph** - If progress stalls after 15-20 minutes, the password likely isn't in your current tables
9. **Export Results Regularly** - Save cracked passwords periodically in case of crashes or interruptions
10. **Combine with Other Tools** - Use OphCrack for simple passwords, then switch to hashcat or John the Ripper for complex ones
